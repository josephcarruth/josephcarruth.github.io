       Recent Graduate of
      <a href="https://www.lehigh.edu/" className="text-sky-700">
      Lehigh University 
      </a>
      . My undergraduate scope as a Mechanical Engineering and Finance
       major through the Lehigh <a href="https://ibe.lehigh.edu/" className="text-sky-700">
      Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program 
      </a>provided me the ability to explore a wide range of topics, industries, 
       and intellectual endeavors. I was able to pursue and obtain minors in both Aerospace Engineering and Economics, highlighting a strong interest in the intersection of technology and business. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify font-light text-gray-600">
       Alongside my academic pursuits, I was a walk-on member of the Lehigh University rowing team, where I competed in the 1st Varsity 8+ boat for all 4 years, receiving numerous personal and team accolades as I gained invaluable experience in teamwork, leadership, and relentless dedication. I also served as the Vice President of the Engineering Honors Society, Tau Beta Pi, the oldest and original chapter of the Engineering Honor Society in the United States.  
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify font-light text-gray-600">
      In my final semester, I took a course with 
      <a className="text-sky-700" href="http://bowen.finance/"> Donald Bowen, </a> 
      titled Advanced Data Science for Investments. My work consisted of creating various event studies, including home price predictors, a natural language processor to forecast returns from 10-K filings, and a Neural Network to predict asset returns. 
      In that same span, I modeled a business jet for former NASA Astronaut Terry Hart's course, Aircraft Design. The aircraft was designed following rigorous aerodynamic analysis, and utilizing OpenVSP software I was able to model and test the aircraft.
